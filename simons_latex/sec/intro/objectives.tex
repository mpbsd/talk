\begin{frame}{Objectives}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      Obtain a formula of Simons'~\cite{simons_minimal_1968} type for a
      hypersurface \(M\) immersed with constant mean curvature into a space
      form;
    \item
      Rewrite such a formula so that the sectional curvature of \(M\) appears
      explicitly in it;
    \item
      Based on this new formula, determine all of the hypersurfaces of
      non-negative sectional curvature immersed with constant mean curvature
      into either \(\ambienteuclideanspace\) or \(\ambientsphere\). In order to
      accomplish that we'll need to ask something more of a certain function,
      as we shall soon see. 
  \end{enumerate}
